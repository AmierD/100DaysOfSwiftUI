## About
This repository documents my progress through Paul Hudson's "100 days of SwiftUI" course. My goal is to get comfortable with the fundamentals of Swift so I can start building some iOS applications!

## **Status**: Completed Day 51 / 100
### Favorite apps so far:
 - Consolidation III | I am really proud of the animations in this times table game

## Learning Strategy
**I learn better and have more fun learning when I get hands-on and actually apply what I am learning.** So, in addition to completing the daily curriculum, I plan on:
 - completing all corresponding **tests/challenges in the Unwrap app** (made by Paul Hudson)
 - using AI to create/review **supplementary problems** to consolidate knowledge periodically
    - these live in the "AIConsolidations" folder of the repo
 - using AI to create **quizzes** on material 
## File Structure:
### `/AIConsolidations/`
### `/Checkpoints/`
### `/Daily/`
    - contains all daily lesson files
### `/Projects/`
### `/Prompts/`
    - contains all prompts used for AI-assisted learning
